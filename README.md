# Artificial-Life

For the current version of the main branch (merged from Person), I added onto Ludobots.  The Person Branch was created from the Quadrupeds Branch, which is the last
part covered by Ludobots.  Person has a few changes.  First off, I switched the morphology to that of a biped with feet.  Second, I added a hidden layer with five
neurons.  Third, I came up with a way to procedurally generate a brain based off of a solution's body.  It is my hope that in the future I can figure out a way to
procedurally generate the body too, but when I tried this it went poorly to say the least.

Running the main.py file will result in the simulation running on a population of 10 bipeds for 100 generations.
